Welcome to experimental design. There are two sets of three exercises provided to explore principles for better experiments. This is a simple book to support the practical, at-home learning associated with experimental design. The text `Experimental Design for the Life Sciences' underpins the design principles \citep{RN6381}.

Life is an experiment. Individually and collectively. We experiment everyday. This is an opportunity to formalize some of those processes and make the learning from experimental design thinking a craft you can apply to all challenges. There are two primary modules to support this process.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Field experiments comprises three outdoor experiments to explore sampling heterogeneous, complex processes in natural systems. The purpose is to provide choice. You need to try each, briefly, as a pilot experiment only. Then, select one to pursue in depth and write up as a research article.
\item
  The data experiments describe the opportunity to use design thinking to structure existing data that others have already collected. The same principles for better experiments still apply in how you reuse the data. There are also three examples provided. Select only one and write up as a note.
\end{enumerate}

Both report formats supported by \href{https://www.facetsjournal.com/about/}{FACETS}. It is the first and only open access science journal in Canada.

\item
  Scout out a location with more than a single species of birds and a frequency of a few different individuals of birds over a 5-10 minute duration.\\
\item
  Select a good spot to the observe birds at your designated location. It can be a balcony or quiet spot. Vegetation such as trees or shrubs can facilitate observation of birds by providing habitat.\\
\item
  Choose a distance that permits enough resolution to see plumage and what an individual bird is doing (depending on whether you are using binoculars, a spotting scope, or unassisted with your vision). There are considerable merits to observing birds more simply \citep{RN6773}. You are also welcome to address any visibility or spotting challenges using bird calls to record frequency of birds in a sampling region.\\
\item
  Specify a duration to sample, for instance, 60 minutes when you have observed the most birds in your scouting exercise. Remember, this is a pilot experiment. Take qualitative notes, sketch, and complete this datasheet.\\
\item
  Use your notes to complete a meta-data file, i.e.~a description of how the data were collected, whether, when, and what each attribute in your dataset means.\\
\item
  Sign out a bird guide for your region from the library or university or try out a \href{https://www.birds.cornell.edu/k12/best-apps-for-birding-with-kids/}{free app} for now to support identification.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsubsection*{Data}\label{data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Data}

\href{https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/BIOL3250_birds_datasheet/12756101}{Here} is a sample datasheet for the pilot experiment. This is set up as species-level observations, i.e.~each row or replicate is a species of bird you observe. This datasheet is for the pilot experiment, and it is a stepping stone for the deeper dive experiment if you choose to complete this experiment for your first report. A more detailed datasheet can consider duration or start and stop times of each individual bird, more details on the environment, or record interesting ecological or environmental variables that are present in the environment too - noise, disturbance, squirrels, other birds, etc.

Data can be organized in many different formats depending on the approach to collecting the data in the field or the lab, the instrument or method used, preference, or accepted standards within the domain of study. In many modern data science endeavours, data are also formatted according to the principles of `tidy data' \citep{RN4416}. The following three rules define data as tidy \citep{RN4369}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each variable must have its own column.\\
\item
  Each observation must have its own row.\\
\item
  Each value must have its own cell.
\end{enumerate}

Most scripting languages such as \href{https://www.r-project.org}{R} or \href{https://www.python.org}{Python} can resolve and tidy up data to adhere to these principles, but with a little planning, your data can be set up to facilitate this process and enable easier data visualization and models.

\textbf{Sample data set}\\
In this example, the field observations were coded as one species per behaviour per row. A compromise between tidiness and ease of collecting the tallies per species in the field.

\begin{tabular}{rllllrl}
\toprule
rep & date & researcher & location & species & frequency & behaviour\\

\hypertarget{meta-data}{%
\subsubsection*{Meta-data}\label{meta-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Meta-data}

In many disciplines of science, meta-data are the descriptive elements of the dataset. They provide a clear means for discovery and reuse of data collected - by you in future and for others \citep{RN3201, RN6774}. For the purposes of our practical learning in experimental design here, describe what each column in our dataset means, describe the structure of your dataset (i.e.~each row is a species-level observation, or plot, or transect), describe the duration of sampling, location, and provide a bit of guidance for someone to use in inspecting the dataset. It is very similar to the methods in conventional publications or standard reports, but it ensures each attribute in the dataset has a brief description. It is also superb preparation for the methods if you choose to write a report.

\hypertarget{deeper-dive}{%
\subsubsection*{Deeper dive}\label{deeper-dive}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Deeper dive}

If you choose this adventure, your goal is to experiment with the method of animal observation to test a hypothesis and predictions. The text `Experimental Design for the Life Sciences' does an excellent job of explaining how to set up hypotheses and predictions \citep{RN6381}. Pilot experiment first, think, explore your data and notes, then write your ideas down that you want to test. A hypothesis is a clear explanation of how a system works \citep{RN6776, RN6775}. The predictions are logical and reasonable outcomes if the hypothesis is a good approximation of how the system works, i.e.~the key variables that make it work. Predictions should be testable and read like simple sentences that describe results. The goal of the deeper-dive experiment is to take your pilot experiment, examine what worked and did not work so well in your experiment, and do a deeper and more thorough job of testing a key idea that you are interested in associated with bird communities in your backyard or neighbourhood. The goal should be to explore one key factor that describes how the species locally interact within one another, the environment or other species, or resources.

\item
  For the purposes of this experiment, focus on on all animals you can spot.\\
\item
  Select a set of locations within the designated area to sample. This can include direct observation of species spots, a region, walking through a region repeatedly. Select the scale carefully that matches what you can observe. This can be relatively unstructured sampling process with the goal of documenting as many species as possible that reside in this place.\\

  Record your data to your datasheet and also consider using the \href{https://www.inaturalist.org}{iNaturalist} free app to record and share your observations globally.

Distributed ecological networks often use surveys done by individuals or small-teams to compile data on species or communities.

If you choose this adventure, your goal is to experiment with the method of measuring plant communities. Innovate on the pilot experiment design and add more depth to your quantitative description of the plant community. These innovations can include deeper insights into the structure of the community (height of plants, density of all plants, or spatial patterns) or the composition (i.e.~species identity, abundance per species per plot, flowering or not, native or invasive, or by plant functional groups). The predictions should be logical and reasonable outcomes if the hypothesis is a good approximation of how the system works, i.e.~the key variables that make it work. Predictions should be testable and read like simple sentences that describe results. The goal of the deeper-dive experiment is to take your pilot experiment, examine what worked and did not work so well in your experiment, and do a deeper and more thorough job of testing a key idea that you are interested in associated with biodiversity patterns locally. The goal should be to explore one key factor that can be used to describe or predict plant community structure or composition for the specific habitat sampled.

\subsubsection*{Deeper dive}\label{deeper-dive-3}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Deeper dive}

If you choose this adventure, your goal is to explore any component of the data to apply design principles. Informally, we are data mining \citep{RN6800}. Data mining is a field of data science and many other disciplines that is exploding in capacity and application \citep{RN6802, RN6801}. Typically, mining data includes seeking patterns and building models that either focus on description or on prediction. Experimental design principles are not always a component of data mining endeavours, and this is unfortunate. We can do better science and build better models with design thinking principles. It is still an experiment, but someone else (or you) collected data. Data can be used for the explicit purpose they were collected, re-purposed to explore another idea, or simply collected without a priori hypotheses and predictions that we derive later. This is where design thinking can make profound contributions. Select a variable from the data that you think can be a meaningful mechanism or explains patterns, describe differences, or predict outcomes. In this example, this design and experimentation process can include good thinking and data use to examine price prediction, likelihood of rares or other card categories, and pattern frequencies by various card attributes.

Diversity data from any citizen science project are profound resources for scientists, non-profits, individuals, managers, and stakeholders. Citizen science is a tool for conservation, data collection, and also policy \citep{RN1320, RN5997}. However, innovation through experimental design is not a component of many projects to date. The bioblitz model is common. We are citizens too as instructors and students, and we interact with a semi-natural, heterogeneous space when we can - campuses. There are at least two examples of data for campuses that can support and enable experimental design thinking. First, the trees on a campus are a viable ecological asset. Second, the biodiversity present on a campus - in addition to human animals.

Data associated with human life. The \href{https://quantifiedself.com}{quantified self} movement is a powerful (and moving) example of personal science and experimental design thinking. It is an experiment of one with trial and error and pre-post intervention thinking. Numerous trackers including smartwatches, phones, dedicated movement trackers such as Fitbits track steps, sleep, heart rate, and numerous other potential indicators of some components of life though big data \citep{RN6807}. This is an opportunity to apply experimental designcraft to yourself and use these experiments to make evidence-informed decisions about exercise, sleep, and work patterns. Gamification is not so different from experimentation in this context and a compelling opportunity to have some fun with activities that you are already doing \citep{RN6808}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Experimental designcraft assessment framework}

There are at least two primary modes of assessment \citep{RN6795}. Formative assessment can happen during the learning process \citep{RN6796}. This active process of engagement with content and doing experiments is critical to becoming an effective life-long learner and successful scientist. In practicing experimental design and doing experiments professionally, this can take the of form of notes, sketches, photographs of the process or experiment at different steps, flowcharts, field and lab notebooks, code, and discussion with collaborators. This process of learning can include feedback from the team (in this course the teaching assistant, the instructor, or peers examining the same challenge). It can be enabled by testing how well one has advanced in achieving specific outcomes. For instance, share your meta-data with a peer and explore whether the individual can understand the meaning of the data and the process of experimentation that supported the collection or reuse of data. Summative assessment can happen at the end of key benchmarks in a learning cycle or at the completion of logical stopping points within the learning process that generated concrete products for review and grading \citep{RN6798}. In this designcraft process of actively exploring experimental design, this can include production of data with meta-data, a lab report describing the deeper dive for one of the field experiments, and a lab report describing the design process of data reuse from one the examples provided. The process of formative asessment (steps along the way) and summative assessment (final products) should support one another to consolidate learning \citep{RN6797}.

A rubric is a scoring tool that enables fair, transparent and replicable grading in summative evaluation \citep{RN6799}. Checklists are useful for formative self or peer assessment in the steps along the way to final products. In designcraft for experiments, this applies to the published data with meta-data and lab reports. In the formal offering of these labs for the course `SC/BIOL 3250 4.00 Experimental design for environmental and evolutionary biology' at York University, the lab component is worth 50\% of the final grade.

This is the marking key you are looking for. This key is used for the field datasets to ensure that you can improve and learn from the process. Reminder, metadata are the `data about the data' - i.e., the descriptions of what each column header means, a list of the key concepts, and a description of the terms within each specific variable. Sometimes, it is really useful to make a short \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.9245}{\textbf{meta-data table}} to describe the data and upload that file with the observational or experimental data too \citep{RNtables}.

Experimental design is a rich field of research, thought, and meta-science. How we do better science and explore the processes that support discovery is one of the most critical and fundamental contributions to social good and society. Individually, it can improve how you make choices. It can also improve your critical thinking capacities. Likely all skills, practice is key. Design thinking and an experimental mindset are worth cultivating and preserving culturally. Simple rules that guide and inform decisions but that adapt is absolutely the space for designcraft to promote scientific literacy and novel forms of creativity. Collectively, these exercises provide only a snapshot of the opportunities to apply scientific design thinking. You will find many other ways to positively apply structured, iterative thinking to all the challenges you tackle.
